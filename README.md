# SafetyNet
iOS app that helps keep people safe when going into a higher risk activity like hiking, going out alone downtown, or walking home in the middle of the night. You simply enter where you're going, where you live, and when you should be home by. You then add up to 3 emergency contacts that will be alerted via text if you don't get home on time (built with Twilio's API). The app also collects your GPS coordinates and stores them, so just in case you get lost on a hike, we will be able to provide search and rescue with your last known location!
